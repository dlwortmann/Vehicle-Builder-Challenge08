## Description
This is a command-line application that I updated to be able to take in additional vehicle types and perform a list of actions to them. Users are prompted to either create a new vehicle by following a list of prompts or select from one that has already been made. A list of actions is then available in the command line that can manipulate a number of methods. This project is an exercise in writing code with  Typescript and Object Oriented Programming.

I'd like to give credit to my study partners Mina and Fischer who were great to bounce ideas off of and helped me work through some bugs in my functions. The Xpert Learning Assistant on BootCampSpot was able to suggest solutions to some bugs within the "tow" and "wheelie" methods.
